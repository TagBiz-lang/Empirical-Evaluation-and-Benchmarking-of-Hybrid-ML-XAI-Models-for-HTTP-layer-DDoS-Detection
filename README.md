# Empirical-Evaluation-and-Benchmarking-of-Hybrid-ML-XAI-Models-for-HTTP-layer-DDoS-Detection

This repository accompanies the replication paper: Empirical Evaluation and Benchmarking of Hybrid ML/XAI Models for HTTP-layer DDoS Detection DDoS Detection (https://www.overleaf.com/project/691d0cdd14d9011193230090)

We studied over 2000 papers and review 210 studies in detail, and reproduce 10 state-of-the-art, benchmarking on CICIDS2017 and a 100k synthetic HTTP-DDoS dataset included here. Hybrid tree/AE models (e.g., XAI-IDS, RF+Autoencoder) lead performance (F1 ≈ 0.997–0.999), while correlation-aware and CNN-LSTM models highlight speed/interpretability trade-offs. The repo provides preprocessing, training, and XAI analyses (SHAP/LIME), and introduces TRUST-AD, a four-tier blueprint for accurate, transparent, real-time defenses.
